Customer: Hi, human. I lost my mom. Can you help me find her?
Customer: She can smell blood. Can I order one cup of blood, so she can find me?
Customer: Oh, right. It's a coffee shop. Can you just add blood in my coffee? Add some of yours please!
You: Yeah..., sure.
You, thinking: Maybe I can give her something else that is similar and doesn't include my blood...
